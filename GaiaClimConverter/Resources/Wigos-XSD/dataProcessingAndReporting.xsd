                        NOTE 1:
                        Atmospheric pressure can be reported
                        as (i) Field elevation Pressure (QFE),
                        where the reference datum is the
                        elevation corresponding to the official
                        elevation of the aerodrome; (ii)
                        Atmospheric pressure at nautical height
                        (QNH), where the reference datum is

                        relationship of the ICAO standard

                        atmospheric pressure cannot be reduced
                        to mean sea level, a station should, by
                        regional agreement, report either the
                        geopotential of an agreed ‘constant
                        pressure level’ or the pressure reduced
                        to an agreed datum for the station. The
                        level chosen for the station should be
                        reported in this field. (Ref: WMO-No. 8

                    <xs:documentation>
                        Measure of the detail in which a numerical quantity is expressed.

                        NOTE 1:
                        The resolution of a numerical quantity is
                        a measure of the detail in which the
                        quantity is expressed. It can be
                        expressed as the smallest possible
                        difference between two numbers. It can
                        also be expressed as the number of
                        significant figures of a number, which are
                        those digits that carry meaning
                        contributing to its resolution.

                        EXAMPLE: if a measurement resolution
                        to four decimal places (0.0001) is given
                        as 12.23 then it might be understood that
                        only two decimal places of resolution are
                        available. Stating the result as 12.2300
                        makes clear that it is precise to four
                        decimal places (in this case, six
                        significant figures).

                        NOTE 2: The notion of measurement
                        resolution is related but must not be
                        confounded with the uncertainty of an
                        observation

                        EXAMPLES:
                        – An anemometer may measure wind
                        speed with a measurement resolution of
                        0.1 ms–1 with a 1 Hz scan rate.
                        Observations may be aggregated to
                        1-minute values and may be rounded
                        and reported with a (reduced)
                        measurement resolution of 1 ms–1.
                        – A barometer may be capable of
                        measuring atmospheric pressure with a
                        readout resolution of 1 hPa and an
                        uncertainty of 5 hPa (k=2). The data can
                        be reported to the nearest hPa, however,
                        the measurement resolution should be
                        stated as “5 hPa” or “3 significant digits”.
                        – An ocean thermometer measures
                        temperature to 0.0001 °C.
                        – Seawater salinity measured to
                        0.001 salinity units (derived from
                        conductivity measurements with a

                        The typical time between completion of the observation or collection of the datum and when the datum is reported.

                        (i) For satellite data, the
                        “observation” (e.g. a complete image)
                        can take 20 minutes to generate. Hence
                        the latency would be the time between
                        the completion of the image collection,
                        and when it is available. Typically this
                        can be 2–3 minutes. Some satellite
                        products such as SST can take about
                        10 minutes of processing until it is
                        available.
                        (ii) A radar volumetric scan can take
                        6–10 minutes (in Australia), so the
                        latency would be the time between the
                        completion of the scan and when the
                        data is locally available. In Australia, this
                        varies between a few seconds to several
                        minutes depending on delays in data
                        communications.
                        (iii) AWS data may have a latency of
                        1–20 seconds (or considerably more in
                        some places) between the completion of
                        the observation and arrival of the data at
                        a central archive.

                        etc. but not raw telemetry signals. Level I data still require

                        obtained directly from many kinds of simple instruments, or
                        derived from Level I data. For example, a sensor cannot
                        measure visibility, which is a Level II quantity; instead, sensors
                        measure the extinction coefficient, which is a Level I quantity.
