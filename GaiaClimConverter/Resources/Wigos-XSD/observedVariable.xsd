                        Time period covered by a series of observations inclusive of the specified date-time indications (measurement history).

                        NOTE 1:
                        The Temporal Extent is defined through the begin and end dates
                        of observations.
                        NOTE 2:
                        If the data are still being added to, omit the End date (but specify
                        a Begin date).
                        NOTE 3:
                        If there are gaps in the data collection (e.g. 1950-1955 then
                        collection resumes 1960-present) then the first date recorded
                        should be the earliest date and the last the most recent, ignoring
                        the gap.

                        EXAMPLES:
                        Surface temperature at the station Säntis has been observed
                        since 1 September 1882. The CO2 record at Mauna Loa extends
                        from 1958 to today. Continuous, 1-hourly aggregates are
                        available from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases for
                        the period 1974-01-01 to 2011-12-31

                    <xs:documentation>
                        Typical spatial georeferenced volume covered by the observations.

                        NOTE 1:
                        The spatial extent of an observed quantity can be a zero-, one-,
                        two-, or three-dimensional feature and will be expressed in terms
                        of a series of geospatial locations describing a geometric shape.
                        NOTE 2:
                        A zero-dimensional geospatial location of an observation implies
                        either an in-situ (point) observation or, by convention, a columnaveraged
                        quantity above the specified geospatial location in nadir.
                        One-dimensional geospatial location of an observation implies a
                        distribution / profile of a quantity along a trajectory (e.g., a straight
                        line from the ground up with a given zenith angle). A twodimensional
                        geospatial location of an observation implies an area
                        or hyper-surface (e.g., a radar image, or a satellite pixel of a
                        property near the surface). A three-dimensional geospatial
                        location of an observation implies a volume-averaged quantity
                        (e.g., a radar pixel in 3D-space).

                        EXAMPLES:
                        i) Air temperature at a surface observing site: Sydney Airport
                        NSW: Lat. -33.9465 N; Lon. 151.1731 E, Alt: 6.0 m above msl.
                        ii) The projected area or volume of the cone around a particular
                        weather radar with a maximum range of 370 km (radar reflectivity)
                        and 150 km (Doppler); to be expressed as a geometric shape.
                        iii) 3-dimensional grid of radar pixels
                        iv) Infrared and visible imagery by meteorological satellite
                        (sunsynchronous): VIRR (FY-3), Global coverage twice/day (IR)
                        or once/day (VIS)
                        v) River discharge by gauge: size and geometric shape of a river
                        Catchment.

                Variable intended to be measured or observed or derived, including the biogeophysical context.

                [ISO19156] NOTE 1:
                In conventional measurement theory the term “measurement” is
                used. However, a distinction between measurement and
                category-observation has been adopted in more recent work so
                the term “observation” is used for the general concept.
                “Measurement” may be reserved for cases where the result is a
                numeric quantity.

                NOTE 2:
                The biogeophysical context is expressed in terms of Domain,
                Subdomain/Matrix, and Layer, and variables are organized
                hierarchically using these dimensions. Relevant domains,
                matrices and layers include atmosphere, aerosol, lake, river,
                ocean, soil, cloud water, aerosol particulate phase, land surface,
                troposphere, upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, space, etc.

                EXAMPLES:
                In hydrology, this would typically be stage or discharge.

                Real scalar quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any other quantity of the same kind
                can be compared to express the ratio of the two quantities as a number.

                JCGM 200:2012, 1.9] NOTE 1.
                Measurement units are designated by conventionally assigned
                names and symbols.

                [JCGM 200:2012, 1.9] NOTE 2
                Measurement units of quantities of the same quantity dimension
                may be designated by the same name and symbol even when the
                quantities are not of the same kind. For example, joule per kelvin
                and J/K are respectively the name and symbol of both a
                measurement unit of heat capacity and a measurement unit of
                entropy, which are generally not considered to be quantities of the
                same kind. However, in some cases special measurement unit
                names are restricted to be used with quantities of a specific kind
                only. For example, the measurement unit ‘second to the power
                minus one’ (1/s) is called hertz (Hz) when used for frequencies
                and becquerel (Bq) when used for activities of radionuclides.

                [JCGM 200:2012, 1.9] NOTE 3
                Measurement units of quantities of dimension one are
                numbers. In some cases these measurement units are given
                special names, e.g. radian, steradian, and decibel, or are
                expressed by quotients such as millimole per mole equal to 10–3
                and microgram per kilogram equal to 10–9.

                [JCGM 200:2012, 1.9] NOTE 4
                For a given quantity, the short term “unit” is often combined with
                the quantity name, such as “mass unit” or “unit of mass”.

                EXAMPLE
                In hydrology, this would typically be m for stage or m3/s for discharge.

                    Spatial extent of the region around the observation for which it is representative.

                    NOTE:
                    The representativeness of an observation is the degree to which it
                    describes the value of the variable needed for a specific purpose.
                    Therefore, it is not a fixed quality of any observation, but results
                    from joint appraisal of instrumentation, measurement interval and
                    exposure against the requirements of some particular application
                    (WMO-No. 8, 2008). Representativeness of an observed value
                    describes the concept that the result of an observation made at a
                    given geospatial location would be compatible with the result of
                    other observations of the same quantity at other geospatial
                    locations. In statistics, the term describes the notion that a sample
                    of a population allows an adequate description of the whole
                    population. Assessing representativeness can only be
                    accomplished in the context of the question the data [or
                    observations] are supposed to address. In the simplest terms, if
                    the data [or observations] can answer the question, it is
                    representative (Ramsey and Hewitt, 2005). The
                    representativeness of an environmental observation depends on
                    the spatio-temporal dynamics of the observed quantity (Henne et
                    al., 2010). Representativeness of an observation can sometimes
                    be specified quantitatively, in most cases qualitatively, based on
                    experience or heuristic arguments.

                    large scale -> An area or volume of 100 km to 3000 km horizontal extent (for example, fronts, various cyclones, cloud clusters)
