                        Procedures involved in obtaining a sample.

                        EXAMPLES:
                        Temperature measurements are made using a XYZ
                        thermometer and reported results are an average
                        of 10 measurements made in a given hour.
                        Aerosols may be sampled with an inlet with sizecutoff
                        at 2.5 μm and be deposited on a teflon filter.
                        Manual reading of a liquid-in-glass thermometer
                        every three hours.
                        As an exception, an observer may observe the
                        state of the sky from home rather than at the
                        station during night.
                        Rain fall is accumulated during the whole week-end
                        and distributed evenly over these 2 days.

                        Chemical or physical treatment of sample prior to analysis.

                        EXAMPLES:
                        Homogenization, milling, mixing, drying, sieving,
                        heating, melting, freezing, evaporation…

                    <xs:documentation>
                        The period of time over which a measurement is taken.

                        NOTE:
                        Includes the sampling time period, plus the
                        meaning of time stamp (11–03).

                        EXAMPLES:
                        surface winds sampled every 0.25 s (frequency
                        4 Hz) (WMO, 2008); surface winds measured once
                        per hour; Barometric pressure measured once
                        every 6 minutes; water column height measured
                        every 15 seconds; water temperature measured
                        once per hour (NOAA, 2009);
                        For each example, Time stamp indicates “end of
                        period”.

                    <xs:documentation>
                        Spatial resolution refers to the size
                        of the smallest observable object.
                        The intrinsic resolution of an
                        imaging system is determined
                        primarily by the instantaneous field
                        of view of the sensor, which is a
                        measure of the ground area viewed
                        by a single detector element in a
                        given instance in time.

                        EXAMPLES:
                        AVHRR: 1.1 km IFOV s.s.p.
                        The sample is a point in space or a very small
                        volume resembling a point, e.g., a temperature
                        sampled by a thermocouple element: No size to be
                        reported;
                        The sample is a line, either straight (e.g., a line of
                        sight of a DOAS instrument) or curved (e.g., the
                        humidity sampled by an aircraft in flight). The
                        ‘length’ of the line is to be reported;
                        The sample is an area, either rectangular or of any
                        other shape, e.g., the pixel of a satellite or the
                        reach of a radar image. The ‘length x length’ of the
                        area is to be reported;
                        The sample is a volume, e.g. a water sample or a
                        well-mixed volume of air sampled by flask. The
                        ‘length x length x length’ of the volume is to be
                        reported.

                        Examples
                        Rain fall observation is accumulated for 24 hours
                        up until 0700z, the diurnal base time here is 0700z.
                        Daily temperature maxima refer to the period 0600
                        local time, the diurnal base time here is 0600z.

                        Zurich airport between 0600 and 1200 local time;
                        Radio-sondes are collected at a particular station
                        from January to August on weekdays at 0000z and

                        Sampling is done continuously, but not necessarily at regular time intervals. Sampling is integrating, i.e., none of
                        the medium escapes observations.
